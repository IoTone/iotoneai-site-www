Children's experience-based summer camp (Imagination to Creation)

1. What is fun to do (Imagination)
1. Practice how to play
1. Create through play (Create)
1. A way of life with a sense of scale
IoTone Japan will be holding the Silicon Valley STEM Camp, a children's summer camp school that focuses on STEM education, English, and coding.
This program is based on Silicon Valley team collaboration, and the skills learned there are a new approach where children work together to solve real-world problems and learn through inquiry-based learning.
Using methods such as "design thinking" and "project-based learning," which are ideas from the Stanford University School of Design, students will learn technology, including coding, which is a required subject in elementary school, based on English education.
The program is aimed at students from the lower grades of elementary school to around the first year of junior high school, and will be limited to the summer vacation period only.
