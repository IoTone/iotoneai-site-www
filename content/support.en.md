## Policies:

IoTone Japan seeks to deliver a satisfactory experience with every purchase of our services.

### RETURNS & EXCHANGES

IoTone Japan gladly accepts returns and exchanges on all items received in like-new condition. Review the IoTone Japan Return and Exchange Policy below and then contact returns@iotone.jp with your order number & explanation for your return. We ask that you be as thorough as possible in describing your reason(s) for return, as detailed feedback directly correlates to improvements in both product design and company operations.

### IoTone Japan RETURN AND EXCHANGE POLICY

In order to qualify for a return or an exchange, items must be sent within 30 days of receipt. Merchandise must be received in like-new condition. If items contain evidence of use or alteration, credits or exchanges may not be issued. Shipping charges are non-refundable.

Returns not meeting the above criteria will be shipped back to the customer at their own expense. Please note that purchases made from the IoTone Japan website are not eligible for return or exchange at any of our retail partners.

Items that are not hard goods, but services or software, will handle returns based on the policy shown on the item's online product page.  Conference Events, for example, are non-refundable unless the event was cancelled or online services failed to function.  Cloud services are refundable based on the terms and conditions of the cloud service (see the service page).

Any refunds or exchanges without the return of merchandise are subject to the discretion of IoTone Japan. Consistent with our overall policy, the shipping charges in these circumstances are non-refundable

### SHIPPING YOUR RETURN

Customers are responsible for all shipping costs associated with returns and exchanges. Ship returns using a reputable shipping company that allows for package tracking. Please insure your goods, as IoTone Japan is not responsible for items lost in transit.

### PROCESSING YOUR REFUND

Please allow up to six (6) weeks from the date IoTone Japan receives your return for processing of your refund. Refunds are credited to the original payment method used at purchase once items have been deemed “like new.” Please allow one billing cycle for a refund to appear on your credit card statement.

### PROCESSING YOUR EXCHANGE

Please allow up to six (6) weeks from the date IoTone Japan receives your return for shipment of your exchanged items. Customers will be offered a refund in the event that the item requested for exchange is out of stock. Price differences between exchanged items will be either credited to or debited from, as applicable, the payment card used for the original purchase.
