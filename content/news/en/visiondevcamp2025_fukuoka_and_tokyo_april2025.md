Happy to announce VisionDevCamp (https://lnkd.in/gkAVr6jc) #Fukuoka 2025, April 11-13. We will be hosting simultaneously with our collaborators in Tokyo who are running VisionDevCamp Tokyo at the same time. Special thanks to The City of Fukuoka and The Engineer Cafe for sponsoring the event. We are deeply thankful for the generous support from STYLY, Inc. My company, IoTone Japan will be co-sponsoring as well. The cost of this event is subsidized by our main sponsor, and we are thrilled to invite the international AR/VR/XR community to the City of Fukuoka. Please DM me if you have questions about the event, have interest in co-sponsoring, or would like to get involved as a speaker, mentor, or volunteer. 

We want to give a nod to the event founders, Raven Zachary and Dom Sagolla for blessing the expansion of this Apple VisionPro Hackathon to Japan.
